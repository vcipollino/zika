# [Zika Virus Overview](https://nextstrain.org/community/vcipollino/zika?d=tree&p=full)

Explore the phylogenetic tree of Zika virus strains. This view provides insights into the evolutionary relationships among different viral samples.
Add more details, add more scientific words
In general add more detail to every slide and make sure it is telling a story on zika. 
How to read a phylo tree and what their grouping means. 
Change the zika tree part to slide 1
make sure you explain the entropy part more 
like you need to walk them through this whole process and see why things matter
why should they have the tree file?
why should they have the map file?
how are they communicating them to their partners?
