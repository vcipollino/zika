# Figures

Upload figures you want to share in your narrative to this directory.
Find the URL of a figure you want to embed in the narrative by selecting the figure's filename in the GitHub file browser and then selecting the "Raw" link for the file.
Use this URL in your narrative with HTML like so:

```html
<img src="PATH_TO_YOUR_FIGURE" alt="Caption for your figure" />
```
